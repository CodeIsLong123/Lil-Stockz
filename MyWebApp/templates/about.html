                This app is supposed to simulate a stock market website
                such as <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com">yahoo finance</a>.
                The app is made as a part of a university project. The app 
                uses the flask library for python to work and run. Relevant data, 
                such as stock data and news, is extracted from a local database. 
                Features that could be improved, where it not for time constraints, 
                would be a clear distinction between stocks you have "bought", and 
                stocks you have put on your watchlist. Additionally, graphs that 
                shows a stocks increase or decrease in value over time would be a 
                great feature. 
                <br><br>
                The project was made by Jan Alexander Peter Johannsen (pqs846) and Asger Rendsmark (jkw944).
